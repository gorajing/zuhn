Reveals that bash commands (grep, find) bypass Claude Code's Read() deny rules,
scanning everything including node_modules. Shows a pre-execution bash validation
hook that blocks 99% of token waste by checking commands against blocked patterns.
Reports 85,000 of 100,000 context tokens were consumed by dependency code before
the fix.
