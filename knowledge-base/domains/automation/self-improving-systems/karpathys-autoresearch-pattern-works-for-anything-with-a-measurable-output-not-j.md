    The Autoresearch loop (change a file, measure the result, keep or discard)
    can optimize any prompt-driven process with measurable outputs — content,
    emails, landing pages, thumbnails.
  standard: >-
    Karpathy's Autoresearch repo was designed for ML training script
    optimization: an AI agent tweaks code, runs it, checks if results improved,
    keeps changes if they did, discards if not, and repeats. He got 11%
    improvement running hundreds of experiments overnight. But the insight most
    people miss is that this pattern generalizes to anything with three
    components: a file to change (the prompt), instructions on what to optimize,
    and a way to measure whether it got better.


    AI Andy mapped this to content creation: the prompt is his train.py, the
    loop instructions are his program.md, and the eval is real views from
    Instagram/Facebook. The same pattern applies to thumbnail prompts, email
    sequences, landing pages, ad copy — any system where a prompt produces a
    measurable output. The key constraint: you need a real, quantitative
    feedback signal, not vibes-based evaluation.
