    Track four quadrants — high eval + high views (validated winners), high eval
    + low views (false positives), low eval + high views (missed patterns), low
    eval + low views (confirmed failures) — to continuously improve both your
    eval and your prompts.
  standard: >-
    Having an eval is necessary but not sufficient — you also need to validate
    that your eval actually predicts real-world performance. AI Andy's system
    correlates eval scores with actual view counts to create four categories:
    high eval + high views (validated winners — the prompt is working), high
    eval + low views (false positives — the eval needs fixing), low eval + high
    views (missed patterns — the eval is missing something important), and low
    eval + low views (confirmed failures).


    This correlation step is what makes the loop genuinely self-improving rather
    than just self-modifying. When the system detects false positives, it knows
    the eval criteria need adjustment. The improved prompt is generated from
    correlation data — winners and failures — not from the eval score alone.
    After five meaningful revisions across two days, the prompts evolved from
    announcement-style framing to curiosity-trigger hooks with personalization
    and universal/timeless framing.
