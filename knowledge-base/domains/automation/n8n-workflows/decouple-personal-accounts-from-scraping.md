  standard: |
    The fundamental safety principle for any scraping operation: never connect
    your personal account directly to the scraping mechanism. Use proxy
    services, dedicated scraping accounts, or third-party APIs that create
    a layer of separation. If the scraping tool gets flagged, rate-limited,
    or banned, your personal account remains completely unaffected. This
    principle applies broadly to LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and any
    platform with anti-scraping measures.
