  standard: |
    Once you have a transcript extraction step in your n8n workflow, the
    same content can be repurposed into multiple formats by adding parallel
    branches after the extraction node. Beyond newsletters, consider:
    social media posts (Twitter threads, LinkedIn carousels), blog article
    drafts, email campaign copy, or Notion knowledge base entries. Each
    branch uses its own LLM prompt tailored to the output format. The
    transcript-to-newsletter workflow is extensible to Mailchimp, Beehiiv,
    ConvertKit, and can add GPT-based quality scoring as an automatic
    review step before publishing.
