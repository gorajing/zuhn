    Full pipeline: search query to scrape 100+ profiles, extract data, pull
    company info, AI-generate personalized opener, export to Google Sheets.

    An n8n workflow automates the full prospect pipeline: start with a search
    query, scrape 100+ LinkedIn profiles via proxy, extract structured data
    (name, title, company, email), pull additional company data from enrichment
    APIs, use AI to generate a personalized opening message based on the
    prospect's profile, and export everything to Google Sheets for sales
    team consumption. Each step is a separate n8n node, making the pipeline
    modular and easy to customize or extend.
