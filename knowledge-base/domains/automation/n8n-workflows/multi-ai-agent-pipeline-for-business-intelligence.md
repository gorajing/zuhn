    Chain specialized AI agents in n8n -- scraper (Firecrawl) feeds analyst
    (Perplexity) feeds formatter (Gemini) -- each agent does one job well,
    keeping the pipeline modular and cheap.
  standard: |
    The business analysis workflow demonstrates a reusable multi-agent
    pattern: a scraper agent (Firecrawl) extracts raw website content, an
    analyst agent (Perplexity) structures and analyzes the data into
    business insights, and a formatter agent (Google Gemini) produces the
    final polished report. Each agent is specialized for one task, making
    the pipeline modular -- you can swap Firecrawl for another scraper or
    Gemini for GPT-4o without rebuilding the whole workflow. This
    separation of concerns also keeps costs low since each agent only
    processes the data relevant to its role.
