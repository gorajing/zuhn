    An eight-layer optimization stack — killing thinking mode, capping context,
    model routing, session resets, lean initialization, Ollama heartbeat, prompt
    caching, and sub-agent isolation — can reduce monthly AI spend from $150 to
    $10.
  standard: >-
    Token costs are the hidden tax on AI agent operations. An eight-layer
    optimization stack addresses this systematically. Layer 1: Kill
    thinking/extended reasoning mode — this is the single biggest hidden cost,
    generating thousands of reasoning tokens before each response for tasks that
    do not require deep reasoning. Layer 2: Cap context windows to prevent
    unbounded token accumulation. Layer 3: Model routing — use an expensive
    'brain' model (like Opus) for orchestration and cheaper 'muscle' models
    (like smaller open-source models) for execution tasks.


    Layers 4-8 add session reset discipline (prevent context bloat across
    conversations), lean session initialization (minimal startup tokens), Ollama
    heartbeat (local model fallback), prompt caching, and sub-agent isolation
    (preventing context leakage between agents). Each layer stacks on the
    previous ones. The key insight is that most routine AI agent tasks do not
    need expensive reasoning — they need fast, cheap execution. Matching model
    capability to task complexity is the core principle.
