    Sequential IDs stored in a file would be hallucinated by the LLM — timestamp
    plus title hash made file creation completely stateless with zero collisions
    across 74 insights.
  standard: |
    An external reviewer identified that sequential IDs stored in a counter
    file would eventually be hallucinated by the LLM — skipping numbers,
    guessing the next value, or creating duplicates. The solution was a
    ULID-inspired scheme: timestamp (date) plus a 4-character SHA256 hash of
    the title, making file creation completely stateless.

    Validated: zero ID collisions across 74 insights. No counter file to
    read, no state to maintain, no race conditions between concurrent agents.
    Each agent can independently generate a unique ID from just the title
    string and the current date.

    General principle: never ask an LLM to maintain sequential state. LLMs
    hallucinate counters, skip numbers, and lose track of sequences. Design
    stateless operations where each invocation is self-contained and
    deterministic from its inputs alone.

  Timestamp-plus-hash IDs are superior to sequential IDs because they are
  completely stateless
