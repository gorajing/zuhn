    Use consistent folder conventions: project/story/task/ with requirements.md,
    instructions.md, research.md, plan.md, code.md, review.md, findings.md.
  standard: |
    Standardize spec artifact locations using a hierarchical folder structure:
    project/story/task/ containing predictable filenames — requirements.md,
    instructions.md, research.md, plan.md, code.md, review.md, findings.md.
    This convention means agents and engineers always know where to find and
    where to write specs without configuration. The hierarchy (project > story
    > task) maps naturally to how work is decomposed, and the fixed filenames
    eliminate ambiguity about what each document should contain.
