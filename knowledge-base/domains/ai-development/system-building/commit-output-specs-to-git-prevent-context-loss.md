    Commit output specs to git so future agents and engineers see what was done,
    what failed, and what decisions were made.
  standard: |
    Output specs (research logs, code notes, findings) should be committed
    to git alongside the code they describe. This prevents context loss
    across agent sessions, team handoffs, and time gaps. When a future
    agent or engineer picks up the work, they can read the committed specs
    to understand not just what was built, but why specific decisions were
    made, what alternatives were considered, and what failed. This is
    especially critical for AI agents that lose context between sessions.
