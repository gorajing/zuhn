    title: 'Debugging as architecture insight: dissecting a VLA'

    Since VLAs eliminate the interfaces needed for classical debugging, you must
    invent new probe methods: attention visualization, camera ablations,
    counterfactual prompting, and primitive action tests.
  standard: >-
    The author develops four debugging techniques for opaque end-to-end models:
    (1) Visualize attention on tokens to check if vision looks at the right
    object. (2) Camera ablations — move or remove cameras to test if vision does
    object detection or spatial template matching. (3) Counterfactual prompting
    — try semantically equivalent prompts ('red block' vs 'red cube') to test
    robustness. (4) Primitive action prompts — test if 'don't move' produces
    motion to reveal training distribution bias. These surface-level probes
    can't fully decompose failures ('is this vision or control?') but they
    identify structural behaviors. This is a transferable methodology for
    debugging any end-to-end system.
