    91 unit tests all passed, but an automated spec audit found 12 issues —
    missing DB columns, wrong MASTER_INDEX format, missing health checks,
    search formula problems. Unit tests verify that code works as implemented;
    spec audits verify that the implementation matches the original intent.

    These are fundamentally different verification levels. Unit tests check
    "does this function return the right value?" Spec audits check "did we
    build what we said we would build?" The 12 issues found by the audit
    were all cases where the implementation drifted from the spec without
    any test failing.

    Practical recommendation: after unit tests pass, run an automated audit
    that reads the spec and checks each requirement against the actual
    implementation. This catches the gap between "working code" and "correct
    code" that traditional testing misses.
