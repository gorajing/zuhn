    Markdown files are the source of truth; SQLite database, indices, mindmap,

    issues, we just regenerated it.
  standard: |
    Markdown files are the source of truth. SQLite database, indices, mindmap,
    and tag files are all generated. When the DB had schema issues during
    Phase 4, we just regenerated it from the markdown files. No data loss,
    no migration scripts, no downtime.

    This is the same principle as "structure over blobs" — the structure (YAML
    frontmatter in markdown files) survives because it is human-readable and
    version-controlled. The views (DB, indices, mindmap) are disposable
    projections that can be rebuilt from source at any time.

    Practical implication: never put primary data in a generated artifact.
    If the source of truth is a generated file, you have a single point of
    failure. If the source of truth is structured plain text, you have
    infinite regenerability.
