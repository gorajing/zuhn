    Classical robotics systems fail loudly (joint limit hit, object not
    detected, planner infeasible). VLAs fail silently — producing
    plausible-looking but wrong trajectories with no mechanism to detect
    out-of-distribution inputs.
  standard: >-
    End-to-end training eliminates the explicit interfaces that make failure
    detection possible. In classical robotics, you can unit-test each stage:
    calibrate cameras → verify detection overlay → check actuators. With VLAs,
    camera extrinsics and joint parameters aren't isolated — the network learns
    spatial transforms end-to-end. The failure boundary is defined implicitly by
    the training distribution, not explicitly by an engineer. You can't issue
    recovery commands ('stop', 'move away') and expect them to override the
    trained behavioral prior. This is the same 'jaggedness' problem Tao
    describes for math AI — VLAs are either on-rails or producing confident
    nonsense.
