    Give agents very specific roles and clear instructions on what to RETURN —
    prevents 'I fixed it!' without details.
  standard: |
    When creating specialized agents (code review, error resolver, etc.),
    define their role narrowly and explicitly specify what they must return.
    Without return instructions, agents tend to say "I fixed it!" without
    providing details about what changed, why, or what to verify. Specify
    the exact output format: which files were changed, what the changes were,
    what was the reasoning, and what needs manual verification. Clear return
    instructions transform agents from black boxes into transparent,
    accountable tools whose work you can review efficiently.
