    Have Claude review its own code via a specialized review agent — catches
    critical errors, missing implementations, and security flaws.
  standard: |
    Create a specialized code review agent that reviews Claude's own output.
    This agent should have a focused role: examine recently written code for
    critical errors, missing implementations (TODO placeholders left behind),
    security flaws (exposed secrets, SQL injection, XSS), and deviations
    from project patterns. A separate review agent catches things the
    original coding context missed because it approaches the code with fresh
    context and a different objective (finding problems vs. building features).
    This two-pass approach — write then review — significantly improves code
    quality without human review bottlenecks.
