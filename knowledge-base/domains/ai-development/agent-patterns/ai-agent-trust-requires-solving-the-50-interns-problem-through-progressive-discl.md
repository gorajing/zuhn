    The biggest barrier to enterprise AI agent adoption isn't model capability
    but trust UX — too many status updates and users say 'stop telling me crap,'
    too few and they say 'what is it doing?' — requiring progressive disclosure
    design patterns that don't yet exist.
  standard: >-
    Atlassian's experience deploying agents in Jira revealed a fundamental
    design paradox: when they gave users detailed step-by-step visibility into
    what the agent was doing, users complained about information overload. When
    they reduced visibility, users lost trust and demanded to know what was
    happening. This mirrors what Cannon-Brookes calls the '50 interns problem' —
    having 50 interns gets a lot of work done, but they also ask you 50
    questions per minute.


    The solution requires solving three layered design challenges: (1) Customer
    trust — how do you build progressive trust so the AI can start taking
    unsupervised actions? (2) Input design — how do you help users provide the
    right context without presenting 17 configuration toggles they don't
    understand? (3) Iteration design — especially in collaborative settings, how
    do you loop human judgment back into agent workflows without breaking flow?


    The key insight from real deployment is that this is primarily a design
    problem, not a model capability problem. Models are 'far ahead of the value
    they're delivering.' The gap is in UX patterns for human-agent collaboration
    — patterns that are roughly where mobile UX was before pull-to-refresh was
    invented. Whatever company solves these design patterns will unlock the
    trapped value in current model capabilities.
