    Structure knowledge as a relational database (entities + relationships), not
    text blobs. Every Claude instance reads/writes the same structured knowledge
    base.
  standard: |
    For cross-instance context sharing (Claude Code, Web, Mobile), structure
    your knowledge base as relational data with explicit entities and
    relationships rather than unstructured text files. Every Claude instance
    reads from and writes to the same structured store. This enables any
    instance to understand not just isolated facts but how concepts relate
    to each other. The relational structure makes knowledge composable —
    new insights can be linked to existing entities rather than duplicated
    as standalone text.
