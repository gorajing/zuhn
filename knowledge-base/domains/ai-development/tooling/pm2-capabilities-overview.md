    PM2 gives you auto-restart on crashes, per-service logs, memory/CPU
    monitoring, and easy management like `pm2 restart email`.
  standard: |
    PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js that provides several
    key capabilities for development workflows: auto-restart on crashes
    (services come back up without manual intervention), per-service log
    files (each microservice gets its own log stream), memory and CPU
    monitoring (spot resource-hungry services), and simple management
    commands like `pm2 restart email` or `pm2 stop auth`. For Claude Code
    workflows specifically, the per-service logs and auto-restart are the
    most valuable — Claude can read logs directly and services stay running
    even if they crash during development.
