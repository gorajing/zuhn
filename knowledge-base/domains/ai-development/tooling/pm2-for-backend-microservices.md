    Run all backend microservices via PM2 so Claude can read individual service
    logs in real-time without manual copy-pasting.
  standard: |
    Instead of running microservices manually in terminal tabs, use PM2 to
    manage all backend services. This gives Claude direct access to individual
    service logs via commands like `pm2 logs email` — no more copy-pasting
    error output from terminal windows. Claude can read logs in real-time,
    correlate errors across services, and debug issues without requiring you
    to be the intermediary. This dramatically reduces the feedback loop for
    backend debugging since Claude can independently investigate service
    behavior.
