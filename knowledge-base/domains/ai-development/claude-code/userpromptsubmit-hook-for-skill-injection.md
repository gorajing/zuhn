    A UserPromptSubmit hook analyzes the prompt for keywords and intent, then
    injects skill reminders into context BEFORE Claude reads it.
  standard: |
    The UserPromptSubmit hook fires before Claude processes a user message. It
    analyzes the incoming prompt for keywords and intent patterns, then injects
    relevant skill reminders directly into the context. This means Claude sees
    the skill instructions alongside the prompt, dramatically improving skill
    adherence. The hook acts as a pre-processor that bridges the gap between
    user intent and skill activation without requiring the user to manually
    invoke skills every time.
