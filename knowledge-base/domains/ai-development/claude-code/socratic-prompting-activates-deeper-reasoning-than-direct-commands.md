    Instead of 'write me X', ask 'what makes X work well?' then 'what principles
    apply here?' then 'now do it for my case' — the model reasons before
    generating instead of pattern-matching to common outputs.
  standard: >-
    Direct commands cause models to go on autopilot and pattern-match to common
    responses. Socratic prompting — asking theoretical questions first, then
    exploring frameworks, then applying to your case — activates reasoning
    pathways from training data (Reddit discussions, Stack Overflow, forum
    conversations where humans reason through problems). Three-step structure:
    (1) Ask what makes this type of thing work well, (2) Explore what principles
    apply, (3) Apply to your specific case. The output is more polished because
    the model actually thought before writing. This mirrors the five-step
    reasoning pattern: Understand → Analyze → Reason → Synthesize → Conclude.
