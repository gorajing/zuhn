    85,000 out of 100,000 context tokens were consumed by dependency code — one
    bash validation hook saved 85% of the context window.
  standard: |
    Without a bash validation hook, Claude Code consumed 85,000 out of
    100,000 context tokens scanning dependency code (node_modules and
    similar directories) through bash commands like grep and find. This
    left only 15% of the context window for actual productive work. A
    single pre-execution bash validation hook reclaimed 85% of the
    context window, dramatically extending how much useful work Claude
    can do before hitting context limits. This is one of the highest-ROI
    optimizations for Claude Code usage.
