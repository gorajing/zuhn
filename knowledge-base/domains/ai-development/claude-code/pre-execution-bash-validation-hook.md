  one_line: "A 5-line pre-execution bash hook checks commands against BLOCKED patterns (node_modules, .env, __pycache__, .git/, dist/, build/) and blocks 99% of token waste."
  standard: |
    Since bash commands bypass Read() deny rules, implement a pre-execution
    bash validation hook — a simple 5-line script that intercepts bash
    commands before execution and checks them against a list of BLOCKED
    patterns: node_modules, .env, __pycache__, .git/, dist/, build/.
    If the command would access a blocked path, the hook exits with error
    code 2, preventing execution. This blocks 99% of accidental token
    waste from Claude scanning large dependency trees or build artifacts
    through bash commands.
