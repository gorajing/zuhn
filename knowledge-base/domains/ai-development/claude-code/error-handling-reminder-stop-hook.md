  standard: |
    The Error Handling Reminder is a Stop hook that scans recently edited
    files for risky patterns: try-catch blocks, async operations, database
    calls, and similar constructs that commonly need careful error handling.
    When detected, it shows gentle self-check reminders rather than hard
    errors. This is intentionally non-blocking — it raises awareness without
    enforcing specific patterns. The philosophy is that a gentle nudge
    catches more issues than strict enforcement, which Claude might work
    around or which could slow down the workflow unnecessarily.
