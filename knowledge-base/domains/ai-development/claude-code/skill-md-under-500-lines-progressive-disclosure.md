    Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines and use progressive disclosure via
    resource files for 40-60% token efficiency improvement.
  standard: |
    Large SKILL.md files waste tokens by loading everything into context
    regardless of relevance. Keep the main SKILL.md under 500 lines with
    a concise overview and essential instructions. Use progressive disclosure
    by linking to separate resource files that Claude can pull in only when
    needed. This approach yields a 40-60% token efficiency improvement because
    Claude only loads the detailed resources when the task actually requires
    them. Structure skills as: core instructions in SKILL.md, detailed examples
    and edge cases in linked resource files.
