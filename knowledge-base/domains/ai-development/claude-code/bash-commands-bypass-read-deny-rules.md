    Bash commands (grep, find) bypass Read() deny rules — they scan everything
    including node_modules even with deny rules configured.
  standard: >
    Claude Code has two separate permission systems that do not communicate

    with each other. The Read() deny rules (e.g., "deny":
    ["Read(node_modules/)"])

    only block the Read tool. Bash commands like grep and find operate outside

    this system and will scan everything, including denied directories like

    node_modules, .env files, and other excluded paths. This means your

    deny rules give a false sense of security — Claude can still access

    denied content through bash commands, consuming massive amounts of

    context tokens in the process.
