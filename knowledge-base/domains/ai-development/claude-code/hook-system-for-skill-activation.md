    Claude won't reliably use skills on its own — build a hook system to inject
    skill reminders automatically.
  standard: >
    Even with exact keyword matches in prompts, Claude does not reliably
    activate

    skills on its own. The solution is to build a hook-based system that
    intercepts

    prompts, analyzes them for keywords and intent patterns, and injects the

    appropriate skill reminders into context before Claude processes the
    message.

    This removes the dependency on Claude's unreliable self-selection and
    ensures

    the right skills are always surfaced when needed.
