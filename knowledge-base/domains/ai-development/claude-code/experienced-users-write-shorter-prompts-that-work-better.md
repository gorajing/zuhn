    Adding instructions to fuzzy tasks creates noise, not clarity. Expert
    prompters write shorter prompts that define the task clearly without
    micromanaging execution — long prompts degrade performance around 3,000
    tokens.
  standard: >-
    Counterintuitive finding: optimal prompt length is 150-300 words, and
    performance degrades around 3,000 tokens. Beginners add more instructions
    hoping for better output, but this creates noise. Experts compress: they
    define what the output should BE (description) rather than adding steps for
    what the model should DO (instructions). 'Think step by step' now actively
    hurts results with newer reasoning models. The difference between 40% and
    90% quality output isn't more words — it's structural clarity. Iteration
    produces quality: first outputs rarely represent final quality, and most
    people stop after Round 1.
