    If output quality seems worse, self-reflect on how you're prompting before
    blaming the model.
  standard: |
    When Claude's output quality drops, the instinct is to blame the model.
    But more often the issue is prompt quality degradation — as you get
    comfortable, you tend to write shorter, less specific prompts. Before
    concluding that the model is worse, audit your recent prompts: Are they
    as detailed as when you started? Are you providing enough context? Are
    you being specific about expected output format? Often, improving your
    prompts immediately restores output quality. The model is more consistent
    than your prompting habits.
