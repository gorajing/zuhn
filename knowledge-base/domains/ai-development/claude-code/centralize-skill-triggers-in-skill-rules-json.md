  standard: |
    Instead of scattering skill activation logic across multiple files, create a
    single skill-rules.json that serves as the central configuration. Each skill
    entry maps to: keywords (simple string matches), intent patterns (regex for
    semantic matching), file path triggers (activate when certain files are
    touched), and content triggers (activate based on file content patterns).
    This centralized approach makes it easy to add, modify, or debug skill
    activation rules without touching hook code. The hook system reads this
    config at runtime to determine which skills to inject.
