    Attach ready-to-use utility scripts to skills so Claude references proven
    tools instead of reinventing test scripts from scratch.
  standard: |
    When a skill involves running tests, data migrations, or other scripted
    operations, attach the actual utility scripts as resources. Instead of
    Claude reinventing a test runner or data seeder from scratch each time,
    the skill references ready-to-use, tested tools. This saves tokens
    (Claude reads a reference instead of generating code), ensures
    consistency (the same proven script is used every time), and avoids
    bugs (Claude's ad-hoc scripts often have edge case issues). Package
    utility scripts alongside their skills and reference them in the
    SKILL.md instructions.
