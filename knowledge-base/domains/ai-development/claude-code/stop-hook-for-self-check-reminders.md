  standard: |
    After Claude finishes responding and editing files, a Stop event hook
    analyzes the changed files for potential issues. It looks for risky
    patterns like try-catch blocks, async operations, and database calls,
    then shows gentle self-check reminders. These are non-blocking awareness
    prompts rather than enforcement — they nudge Claude to reconsider its
    error handling without interrupting the workflow. This passive quality
    gate catches issues that would otherwise slip through.
