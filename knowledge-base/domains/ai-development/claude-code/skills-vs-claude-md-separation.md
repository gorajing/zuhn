    Maintain a clear separation of concerns between Skills and CLAUDE.md.
    Skills should contain general coding guidelines — how to write code,
    patterns to follow, error handling approaches, testing conventions.
    CLAUDE.md should contain project-specific context — architecture decisions,
    service relationships, deployment details, environment setup. This
    separation means skills are reusable across projects while CLAUDE.md
    remains project-specific. It also prevents bloat in either file and
    makes it clear where to add new information.
