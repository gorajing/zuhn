    The full hook pipeline runs in sequence: Claude responds, Prettier formats
    code, build checker catches errors, error reminder does a self-check — zero
    errors left behind.
  standard: |
    The complete hook pipeline operates as a sequential quality gate after
    every Claude response: (1) Claude writes code and responds, (2) Prettier
    auto-formats all edited files to enforce consistent style, (3) the Build
    Checker runs builds on affected repos and catches TypeScript/compilation
    errors, (4) the Error Handling Reminder scans for risky patterns and
    shows self-check nudges. This layered approach means each stage catches
    different categories of issues. The result is zero errors left behind —
    formatting, compilation, and error handling are all verified automatically
    before you move on.
