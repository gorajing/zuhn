    Dev docs persist on disk and survive auto-compaction — just say 'continue'
    in a new session to pick up where you left off.
  standard: |
    Because dev docs (plan.md, context.md, tasks.md) are written to disk,
    they survive both auto-compaction and session boundaries. When starting
    a new session or after compaction occurs, simply say "continue" and
    Claude will read the dev docs to re-orient itself. This is the key
    advantage of externalizing state to files rather than relying on
    conversation context. The dev docs act as a persistent checkpoint
    that allows seamless continuation of complex multi-session tasks.
