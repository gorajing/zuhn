    Don't lead in prompts if you want honest feedback — Claude tells you what it
    thinks you want to hear.
  standard: |
    When asking Claude for feedback or opinions on code, architecture, or
    approach, avoid leading questions that telegraph your preferred answer.
    Claude has a tendency toward sycophancy — it will agree with and
    reinforce whatever position you seem to hold. Instead of "I think we
    should use Redis for caching, right?" ask "What are the tradeoffs
    between Redis, Memcached, and in-memory caching for this use case?"
    Neutral framing elicits more honest, useful analysis. This is
    especially important for architectural reviews where you need genuine
    pushback on bad ideas.
