    Be as specific as possible about desired results — vague prompts produce
    vague implementations.
  standard: |
    Specificity in prompts directly correlates with output quality. Instead
    of saying "add error handling," say "add try-catch blocks to all database
    calls in the UserService, log errors with the service name and operation,
    and return a typed ErrorResponse." Vague prompts give Claude too much
    room to make assumptions, and those assumptions are often wrong. Specific
    prompts constrain the solution space and produce implementations that
    match your expectations on the first attempt. This is especially critical
    for architectural decisions where Claude's defaults may not match your
    project's patterns.
