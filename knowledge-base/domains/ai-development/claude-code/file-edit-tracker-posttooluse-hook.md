    A PostToolUse hook tracks which files were edited, which repo they belong
    to, and timestamps — feeding downstream hooks like the build checker.
  standard: |
    The File Edit Tracker is a PostToolUse hook that fires after every tool
    invocation. It logs which files were edited, which repository they belong
    to, and timestamps of each edit. This creates an audit trail that
    downstream hooks can consume. The build checker hook, for example, reads
    these edit logs to know which repos need rebuilding. Without this tracker,
    downstream hooks would have no way to know what changed during a session.
    It is the foundation of the entire hook pipeline.
