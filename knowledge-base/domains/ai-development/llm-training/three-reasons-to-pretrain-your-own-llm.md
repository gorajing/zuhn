  standard: |
    The Smol Training Playbook's "Training Compass" section provides a
    decision framework for whether to pretrain your own model. There are
    exactly three legitimate reasons: (1) advancing research by exploring
    novel questions that existing models cannot answer, (2) meeting specific
    production requirements that no available model satisfies (latency,
    domain specialization, data sovereignty), and (3) filling gaps in the
    open-source ecosystem where no suitable model exists. If your use case
    does not fit one of these three categories, fine-tuning an existing
    model is almost always more cost-effective. HuggingFace frames this
    from their own journey building BLOOM, StarCoder, and SmolLM families.
    Note that pretraining a model comparable to Llama 3 requires only 2-3
    people with sufficient compute access.
