    Bayesian wind tunnel experiments prove transformers perform exact Bayesian
    posterior updating to 10^-3 bits accuracy, but this mechanism is purely
    correlational — not causal.
  standard: >-
    Vishal Misra's research at Columbia created 'Bayesian wind tunnels' —
    controlled environments where blank architectures are given tasks impossible
    to memorize but tractable enough to compute the exact Bayesian posterior
    analytically. Transformers matched the precise Bayesian posterior down to
    10^-3 bits accuracy. The key distinction is between Shannon entropy
    (correlation/prediction from patterns) and Kolmogorov complexity (the
    shortest program that reproduces something). LLMs operate in the Shannon
    entropy world — they find correlations in training data. The digits of pi
    have infinite Shannon entropy but very small Kolmogorov complexity. Deep
    learning cannot cross from correlation to the causal, compressed-program
    world that true intelligence requires.
