    All AI computation is matrix multiplication (word relationships scored as
    points in matrices) — Hinton discovered GPUs excelled at this by accident in
    2012, winning ImageNet overwhelmingly.
  standard: >-
    Professor Kim explains AI computation from first principles: when processing
    'I am a boy,' AI scores relationships between every pair of words (1-100
    points). With millions of words in training data, these relationships form
    massive matrices. AI generates output by predicting the most probable next
    word based on these matrix calculations. GPUs were originally designed for
    graphics — updating millions of pixels simultaneously requires the same
    matrix multiplication that AI needs. Geoffrey Hinton didn't plan to use
    GPUs; he was looking for hardware that could do matrix calculations well,
    tried GPUs, and they worked perfectly. The 2012 ImageNet competition proved
    it definitively — GPU-based AI won 'completely, truly overwhelmingly.' This
    accidental discovery is why NVIDIA now dominates AI infrastructure.
