- `INS-260320-7682` [high] Run systematic ablation experiments on architecture, data mixtures, and hyperparameters at small scale before committing to a full training run -- this consumes ~37% of total compute but prevents costly mistakes.
- `INS-260320-5818` [high] Main pretraining consumes 63% of total compute; plan for 37% additional budget for ablation studies, debugging, and restarts due to infrastructure failures.
- `INS-260320-7B4B` [high] HuggingFace's 200-page training playbook concludes that data quality dominates architectural innovation as the key factor in LLM performance.
- `INS-260320-C65B` [high] The Smol Training Playbook is a 200+ page open guide covering the full LLM pipeline from strategic planning through post-training, based on training SmolLM3 (3B params, 11T tokens).
- `INS-260320-922A` [high] Only pretrain your own LLM for three reasons: advancing research with novel questions, meeting specific production requirements, or filling gaps in the open-source ecosystem.
