    Run systematic ablation experiments on architecture, data mixtures, and
    hyperparameters at small scale before committing to a full training run --
    this consumes ~37% of total compute but prevents costly mistakes.
  standard: |
    The Smol Training Playbook details a rigorous ablation methodology:
    before committing to a full-scale training run, conduct systematic
    experiments varying architecture choices (attention mechanisms,
    positional encodings, dense vs. MoE), data mixtures (web, multilingual,
    math, code ratios), tokenizer selection, and optimizer hyperparameters.
    Run ablations at smaller scale to validate assumptions. The playbook
    evaluates multiple training frameworks (Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed,
    TorchTitan, Nanotron) and uses structured benchmarking for evaluation.
    Key lesson: intuitive assumptions frequently fail with LLMs, making
    empirical ablation the only reliable way to make decisions. Data
    ablation frameworks are particularly important for validating domain
    mixtures and curriculum strategies.
