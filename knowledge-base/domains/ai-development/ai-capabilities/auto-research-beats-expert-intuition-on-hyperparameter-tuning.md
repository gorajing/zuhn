    Karpathy's auto-research loop found hyperparameter improvements overnight
    that his two decades of ML experience missed — the agent found weight decay
    and Adam beta issues that interact jointly.
  standard: >-
    After manually tuning his GPT model for months using his own expert
    intuition from two decades of ML research, Karpathy let auto-research run
    overnight. It found improvements he didn't see — specifically weight decay
    on value embeddings and insufficiently tuned Adam betas. The key insight is
    that these parameters interact jointly, so tuning one changes what's optimal
    for others. No human can efficiently search this joint space. If it works on
    a 'fairly well tuned' model, it works on anything.
