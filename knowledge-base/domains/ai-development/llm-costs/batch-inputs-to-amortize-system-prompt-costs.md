    Batch inputs to amortize system prompt costs — 100 separate calls with a
    500-token system prompt = 50,000 wasted tokens. 1 batched call = 500 tokens.
  standard: |
    Every API call includes the full system prompt in the token count. With
    100 separate calls each carrying a 500-token system prompt, you waste
    50,000 tokens on repeated system prompts alone. By batching multiple
    inputs into a single call, you pay the system prompt cost once. This
    yields up to 100x token reduction on the system prompt portion. The
    key constraint is staying within the model's context window, but for
    most categorization and summarization tasks, batching 10-100 items
    per call is practical.
