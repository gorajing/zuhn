    Use cheap models (gpt-5-nano) for categorization/relevance scoring before
    expensive models — removes 70-90% of irrelevant inputs.
  standard: |
    Implement a tiered model pipeline: use an ultra-cheap model (e.g.,
    gpt-5-nano) as a first pass to categorize and score inputs for relevance.
    Only inputs that pass the relevance threshold get forwarded to the
    expensive model. This two-stage approach removes 70-90% of irrelevant
    inputs at near-zero cost. The cheap model acts as a smart filter that
    understands context, unlike simple heuristic filters.
