    Let AI rewrite your prompts in the model's own 'language' for 20-30% quality
    improvement using the meta-prompt technique.
  standard: |
    Instead of hand-crafting prompts, use a meta-prompt technique: describe
    the task, input format, and desired output to the model, then ask it to
    write the optimal prompt for itself. This leverages the model's
    understanding of its own token processing patterns and attention
    mechanisms. Reports indicate 20-30% quality improvement on outputs,
    which indirectly reduces costs by eliminating retry loops and
    post-processing steps.
