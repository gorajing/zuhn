    Filter aggressively before hitting expensive models — filtering by
    upvotes/comments removes 80% of inputs, saving ~$5/week.
  standard: |
    Before sending data to expensive LLM calls, apply simple heuristic
    filters to eliminate low-value inputs. For social media data, filtering
    by engagement metrics (upvotes, comments, shares) removes approximately
    80% of inputs that would produce low-quality or irrelevant outputs.
    This is pure cost savings with no quality loss — you are only removing
    inputs that would not have produced useful results anyway. At scale,
    this saves ~$5/week per pipeline.
