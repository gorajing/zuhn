    Keep spec templates simple — if too heavy, people skip them. Automate file
    creation and periodically revisit findings for tech debt.
  standard: |
    The biggest risk to SDD adoption is template complexity. If specs are
    burdensome to create, teams will skip them and the system collapses.
    Keep templates minimal — a few required fields and free-form sections.
    Automate file creation with scripts or hooks so starting a new task
    auto-generates the spec skeleton. Periodically review accumulated
    findings to surface recurring patterns that indicate tech debt or
    architectural issues that need addressing.
