    Use tools like PostHog and RevenueCat experiments to A/B test onboarding
    screens, paywalls, and pricing in isolation — removing just 3 screens can
    drop conversion to zero.
  standard: >-
    Arthur ran structured A/B tests across onboarding flows, paywall designs,
    pricing, and even App Store icons. His most striking finding: a 'less
    personal questions' variant that removed three onboarding screens drove zero
    conversions, while a 'no-pact' variant that removed a different screen
    significantly outperformed the control on both completion and conversion.


    The methodology: use PostHog for onboarding flow experiments (tracking
    completion rate and conversion rate per variant) and RevenueCat for paywall
    design experiments (tracking initial conversion rate). Wait for 50+
    conversions per variant before declaring a winner. Test one variable at a
    time. He also discovered that time-of-day ad scheduling (analyzing trial
    conversion by hour via RevenueCat data) and billing grace periods (turning
    on 3-day retry for failed charges recovered ~10% more revenue) were easy
    wins hiding in dashboard settings.
