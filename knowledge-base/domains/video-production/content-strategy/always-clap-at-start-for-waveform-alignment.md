    Always clap once or use a clapboard at the start of each take -- the sharp
    transient creates a visible spike in both audio waveforms, making manual
    sync alignment trivial.

    When recording video and audio separately (external microphone, field
    recorder), always create a sync point at the start of each take by
    clapping hands once or using a clapboard. The sharp transient sound
    creates a distinctive spike visible in both the camera's scratch audio
    waveform and the external recorder's waveform. In your NLE (Premiere,
    DaVinci Resolve, Filmora), align these spikes to achieve frame-accurate
    sync. This is more reliable than automatic sync tools for problematic
    recordings. Always record scratch audio on camera even when using
    external audio -- it serves as the sync reference. For multi-camera
    setups, timecode sync is preferred, but the clap method works as a
    reliable fallback.

  A clap or clapboard at each take start is essential for reliable audio-video
  sync alignment
